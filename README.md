Web scraping is the process of automating the extraction of information from websites. One example of this is scraping the prices of phones from the website Jumia.com.ng. Here is a basic outline of how you might go about web scraping phone prices from Jumia.com.ng:

1. Inspect the website: Before you begin web scraping, you'll need to inspect the website to determine the structure of the pages and identify the specific elements that contain the information you're looking for. In this case, you'll need to locate the page or pages that contain the phone prices.

2. Choose a web scraping tool: There are many different web scraping tools available, such as Python's Beautiful Soup library, Scrapy, or import.io. You'll need to choose a tool that you're comfortable using and that is compatible with the website you're scraping.

3. Write code to extract the data: Using the web scraping tool and the information you gathered from inspecting the website, you'll need to write code to extract the specific data you're looking for, such as the phone prices.

4. Store the data: Once you've extracted the data, you'll need to store it in a format that is easy to work with, such as a CSV file or a spreadsheet.

5. Schedule and automate the scraping: Scraping price of phone on Jumia can be done in real-time, but you can schedule it to run on a regular basis (daily, weekly, monthly) so that you can have the most up-to-date information.

It's important to note that web scraping can be against the terms of service of some websites, and some websites may have protections in place to prevent scraping. You should always check the website's terms of service and be respectful of their policies.

Also, web scraping is a complex task, it requires knowledge of web development, and programming. And it's always better to use scraping tools or services that are legally compliant.
